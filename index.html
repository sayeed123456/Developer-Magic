            <h3>Turn her sister back to human</h3>
            <p>Tanjiro Kamado (竈門かまど 炭たん治じ郎ろう Kamado Tanjirō?) is the main protagonist <br>
                of Demon Slayer: Kimetsu no Yaiba.
                He is a Demon Slayer in the Demon Slayer Corps,<br>
                who joined to find a remedy to turn his sister, Nezuko Kamado, back into a human <br>
                and to hunt down and kill demons,
                and later swore to defeat Muzan Kibutsuji, <br>
                the King of Demons, in order to prevent others from suffering the same fate as him. <br>

                Before he became a Demon Slayer, Tanjiro was a coal burner before his entire family <br>
                was slaughtered by Muzan while his younger sister,
                Nezuko, was turned into a demon.</p>
